\subsection{Momentum resolution}

Figure ~\ref{fig:dio_1} overlays the electron momentum spectrum measured by SINDRUM-II
and the DIO spectrum on \Pb{208} calculated in \cite{Watanabe_1993} shifted by 0.5 MeV.
It is clear that the two spectra have quite different slopes.
The sign of the difference is easy to understand; in the case of a rapidly falling
spectrum, the finite experimental resolution smears the spectrum and effectively
reduces the observed slope.

We make a [simplified] assumption that the detector momentum resolution response
is symmetric and can be described by a single Gaussian function. 
The experimental momentum resolution is one of the parameters of the detector response model.
To choose the optimal value, we vary the resolution in the range [1, 3.5] MeV/c, convolve the
theoretical DIO spectrum with the given resolution, and use the resulting distribution to fit
the SINDRUM-II electron spectrum. The fit has one parameter - normalization. The fit $\chi^2$ dependence
on $\sigma_P$ is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step1_fit_sigma}, the best value of the resolution
parameter is $\sigma_P = 2.0 \pm 0.1$ MeV/c. This value is significantly higher than the momentum
resolution of the SINDRUM-II detector and is likely due to that contribution of RMC electrons
not accounted for in the procedure. As one can see from Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_2006_fig_11},
for momenta close to 90 MeV/c, the contribution of RMC could be non-negligible. As the RMC spectrum
is less steep than the DIO one, ignoring the RMC contribution should result in a larger value of the
best resolution parameter returned by the procedure described above.

\subsection{Tracking efficiency}

To parameterize the SINDRUM-II tracking efficiency, we assume that it is flat
above 80 MeV/c. Normalizing the DIO spectrum convolved with $\sigma_P = 2.0$ MeV/c
resolution to the electron data in the region p > 80 MeV/c and dividing the data spectrum
by the resulting distribution gives the ``efficiency'' dependence on the track momentum
shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step1_efficiency}. This distribution is fit well by a 
linear efficiency below 80 MeV/c and flat above this.

This step concludes tuning of the detector response. Figure \ref{fig:ana_step1_best_dio_fit}
shows the description of the electron spectrum with the tuned response.
