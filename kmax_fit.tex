\section {RMC spectrum and $\kmax$ determination}

Measured RMC photon spectra on nuclei can be successfully described within 
the closure approximation which predicts the RMC photon spectrum depending
on just one parameter - the photon spectrum endpoint:
$$
    \frac{dN}{dE} ~=~ \frac{e^2}{\pi} \frac{\kmax^2}{ m_{\mu}^2} (1 - \alpha) (1-x+2x^2)x(1-x)^2
$$
where E is the photon energy, $\kmax$ is the energy spectrum endpoint, $\rm \alpha = (N-Z)/A$,
and $x = E/\kmax$ \cite{Christillin_1980}.

Values of $\kmax$ for different nuclei are not predicted, but determined from the fits
to experimental data. Typically, fits return $\kmax$ values significantly lower than
the kinematically allowed limits. 

We determine the value of the $\kmax$ parameter by fitting the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum
with a closure approximation spectrum convolved with the resolution $\sigma_P = 2$ MeV/c
and the efficiency determined from the fit to the electron spectrum
(see Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step1_efficiency}) and vary the value of $\kmax$.
Results of the fit are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step2_fit_kmax}, the best fit
corresponds to $\kmax = 88.0 \pm 0.6$ MeV.
%
With the energy losses taken into account, the value becomes  $\kmax = 88.6 \pm 0.6$ MeV.
The maximal photon energy allowed kinematically in a 
$$
\rm \mu^- + \Au{197}(GS) \rightarrow \nu +\gamma + ^{197}Pt(GS)
$$
transition is $E_{max} = 93.8$ MeV, which is several MeV higher.
