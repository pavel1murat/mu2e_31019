\section {RMC spectrum and kMax Determination}

Measured RMC photon spectra on nuclei can be successfully described within 
the closure approximation which predicts the RMC photon spectrum depending
on just one parameter - the photon spectrum endpoint:
$$
    {dN \over dE} ~=~ {e^2 \over \pi } {k_m^2 \ \over m_{\mu}^2} (1 - \alpha) (1-x+2x^2)x(1-x)^2
$$
. where E is the photon energy, $k_m$ is the energy spectrum endpoint, $\rm \alpha = (N-Z)/A$,
and $x = E/k_m$  \cite{Christillin_1980}.
