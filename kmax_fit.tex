\section {RMC spectrum and $\kmax$ determination}

Measured RMC photon energy spectra on nuclei can be successfully described
within the model called closure approximation, which predicts the RMC photon
spectra depending on just one parameter - the photon spectrum endpoint:
$$
    \frac{dN}{dE} ~=~ \frac{e^2}{\pi} \frac{\kmax^2}{ m_{\mu}^2} (1 - \alpha) (1-x+2x^2)x(1-x)^2
$$
where E is the photon energy, $\kmax$ is the energy spectrum endpoint, $\rm \alpha = (N-Z)/A$,
and $x = E/\kmax$ \cite{Christillin_1980}.

Values of $\kmax$ for different nuclei are not predicted, but determined from the fits
to experimental data. Typically, fits return $\kmax$ values significantly lower than
the kinematically allowed limits. 

Internal conversions, or off-shell RMC photons, also contribute to the measured
spectrum. Assuming that their energy distribution is the same as the energy distribution
of the on-shell photons, and the energy sharing between the positron and electron
to be similar in both cases, the contribution of the off-shell photons should be
accounted for by the spectrum normalization.

We determine the value of the $\kmax$ parameter by fitting the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum
with a closure approximation spectrum convolved with the resolution $\sigma_P = 2$ MeV/c
and the efficiency determined from the fit to the electron spectrum
(see Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step1_efficiency}) and varying the value of $\kmax$.
Dependence of the fit $\chi^2$ on $\kmax$ is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ana_step2_fit_kmax},
the best fit corresponds to $\kmax = 88.0 \pm 0.6$ MeV.
%
With the positron energy losses taken into account, the value becomes $\kmax = 88.6 \pm 0.6$ MeV.
Consistent with the available experimental data, the maximal photon energy allowed kinematically
in a $\rm \mu^- + \Au{197}(GS) \rightarrow \nu +\gamma + ^{197}Pt(GS) $ transition
is $E_{max} = 94.8$ MeV, several MeV higher than the \kmax\ value corresponding to the best fit.
