\section { Introduction}

The most stringent search limits for processes of \mumemconv\ and \mumepconv\
on nuclei come from the SINDRUM-II experiment \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}.

Br($\mu^- Au \rightarrow e^- Au) < 7·10^{-13}$ and

$Br(\mu^- Ti \rightarrow e^+ Ca) < 1.7·10^{-12}(GS)$

SINDRUM-II collected x2 muon stops on Au data as the 1997 Ti data,
and their '2006 paper also presented the positron data.
However no limit on \mumepconv\ has been published.

In this note we're trying to take a close look at the SINDRUM-II positron data
and understand their implications for the Mu2e search for \mumepconv\ .

Positron spectrum seems to have a bump near its high-momentum endpoint.
In this note we try to understand what are the implications of this bump
for the Mu2e search for the process of \mumepconv\ .

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section { Approach}

We start from assuming that the dominant background in electron channel comes from DIO,
while the positron spectrum is dominated by the positrons from RMC photon conversions.
For \Au{197}, these assumptions hold better for positrons than for electrons:
in the vicinity of 90 MeV, RMC electrons also need to be taken into account.
There are more electrons than positrons (Compton scattering of the RMC photons),
so we just acknowledge the fact, but don't take any action, as the momentum distribution
of the electrons due to Compton scattering is not given in the 2006 paper.

SINDRUM-II used DIO spectrum on Pb tabulated in \cite{Watanabe_1993} and corrected for the
difference of binding energies in \Au{197} and \Pb{208} for the DIO.

We use the electron spectrum to develop a simple parameterized model of
the SINDRUM-II detector response. The parameters include the momentum resolution,
assumed to be constant, and the overall reconstruction efficiency dependence on the 
track momentum.

We then use the response model to fit the positron spectrum below 88 MeV and
determine the RMC kMax. After that, we can predict the expected background
above 88 MeV and quantify the observed excess.

Finally we check if the observed excess is consistent with the signal expected from
\mumepconv\ on \Au{197}.

\section {Events above 88 MeV and \mumepconv\ signal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection {Expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ signal in SINDRUM-II detector}

Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal} shows expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$
conversion signal in SINDRUM-II detector digitized from Figure 11 of \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}. 
The most probable value is at 95.0 MeV, consistent with the most probable energy
losses of 0.6 MeV in front of the tracker.

For Au, the expected position of $\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$ is about 3.9 MeV/c lower than
for $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ signal, the difference small enough to affect the momentum
resolution.
%
We therefore assume that the position and shape of the $\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$ signal
expected in the SINDRUM-II detector can be represented with the accuracy
of about 0.1 MeV/c by the signal shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal}
moved by 4 MeV/c lower.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection {Positron momentum spectrum}

We therefore shift the expected signal distribution from fig.11 by 4 MeV down
and show it in Figure \ref{fig:ana_step2_sindrum_positron_best_fit_signal} together
with the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum. To guide the eye, the signal is normalized
to 20 events.

The group of events observed above 88 MeV/c is lower than the expected signal by
about 1 MeV. Statistical uncertainty on their center of gravity is 0.24 MeV/c,
so the expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion signal is about 4$\sigma$ higher.
This strongly disfavors an conversion interpretation of the excess.

However, to make a bump, a statistical fluctuation is required.

There are 456 events in the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum above 77 MeV/c,
14 events above 88 MeV/c. One - cosmics, 13 events from 88-92 MeV/c.
Assuming flat distribution: 13*92/4 = 13*23 = est 300 events corresponding to
the Au(GS) --> Pt(GS) transition.

RMC spectrum with kmax 88 MeV: 13.75\% events above 57 MeV/c.
TRIUMF measurements: 2000-3000 data events per spectrum, ==> 15,000 - 20,000
events total.

RMC positron spectrum: 3.3e-4 above 77 MeV/c, 442 events ---> 1.3e6 RMC events total,
two orders of magnitude higher than per-target statistics of TRIUMF RMC spectrometer.

The extimated branching ratio of exclusive transition would be 
$\sim 3e^2/1.3e^6 ~ \sim ~ 2e^{-4}$, and for the TRIUMF statistics one would expect
$2e^4*2e^{-4} ~\sim 5$ events. For a photon energy resolution FWHM $\sim$ 7 MeV,
it would be rather difficult for the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer group to see 
exclusive transitions of this strength in the measured spectra.

\section{ Summary }

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SINDRUM-II positron spectrum on Au shows a statistically significant excess
  of events (roughly, 13 events with 1 expected) if we assume that over the RMC
  spectrum is described by the closure approximation.
\item
  the limit on BGR comes from cosmics and RPC, RMC << 1  event
\item
  the excess looks like a bump with the width consistent with the detector
  resolution
\item
  the expected position of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion signal on Au is
  about 1 MeV/c or, statistically, 4*$\sigma_P$ higher, which strongly discourages
  the exotic interpretation
\item
  the excess could be due to and exclusive RMC transition Au(GS) --> Pt (GS)
  with the branching fraction of about $2\cdot10^{-4}$, which is spin/parity
  allowed. Given the statistics and the resolution of the published RMC
  measurements, such a transition would not be resolved. 
\item
  This observation has significant implications for the upcoming searches
  for the process of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion. 
  to fully exploit the physics potential of experiments like Mu2e and COMET,
  a better theoretical understanding of the endpoint of the RMC spectrum
  on nuclei is needed. 
\item
  Without that, the sensitivity for might be limited by the presently unknown
  dipole RMC transitions to exclusive states of the daughter nuclei. 
\end{itemize}
