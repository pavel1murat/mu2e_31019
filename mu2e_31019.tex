\section { Introduction}

The most stringent search limits for processes of \mumemconv\ and \mumepconv\
on nuclei come from the SINDRUM-II experiment \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}.

Br($\mu^- Au \rightarrow e^- Au) < 7·10^{-13}$ and

$Br(\mu^- Ti \rightarrow e^+ Ca) < 1.7·10^{-12}(GS)$

SINDRUM-II collected x2 muon stops on Au data as the 1997 Ti data,
and their '2006 paper also presented the positron data.
However no limit on \mumepconv\ has been published.

In this note we're trying to take a close look at the SINDRUM-II positron data
and understand their implications for the Mu2e search for \mumepconv\ .

Positron spectrum seems to have a bump near its high-momentum endpoint.
In this note we try to understand what are the implications of this bump
for the Mu2e search for the process of \mumepconv\ .

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section { Approach}

We start from assuming that the dominant background in electron channel comes from DIO,
while the positron spectrum is dominated by the positrons from RMC photon conversions.
For \Au{197}, these assumptions hold better for positrons than for electrons:
in the vicinity of 90 MeV, RMC electrons also need to be taken into account.
There are more electrons than positrons (Compton scattering of the RMC photons),
so we just acknowledge the fact, but don't take any action, as the momentum distribution
of the electrons due to Compton scattering is not given in the 2006 paper.

SINDRUM-II used DIO spectrum on Pb tabulated in \cite{Watanabe_1993} and corrected for the
difference of binding energies in \Au{197} and \Pb{208} for the DIO.

We use the electron spectrum to develop a simple parameterized model of
the SINDRUM-II detector response. The parameters include the momentum resolution,
assumed to be constant, and the overall reconstruction efficiency dependence on the 
track momentum.

We then use the response model to fit the positron spectrum below 88 MeV and
determine the RMC kMax. After that, we can predict the expected background
above 88 MeV and quantify the observed excess.

Finally we check if the observed excess is consistent with the signal expected from
\mumepconv\ on \Au{197}.

\section {Events above 88 MeV and \mumepconv\ signal}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection {Positron momentum spectrum}

Figure \ref{fig:ana_step2_ppos_best_fit} overlays the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum on
\Au{197}\ target with the closure approximation spectrum convoluted with the 
parameterized model of the SINDRUM-II detector response.

There are 14 events above 88 MeV in the data.

Looking at the data above 94 MeV, we can estimate the background due to radiative
pion capture (RPC) and cosmics to be of the order of one event.
Prediction of the closure approximation-based RMC model gives significantly less
than one event.

We therefore need to ask whether the closure approximation gives a reliable
description of the RMC positron spectrum near the end point. The closure approximation
doesn't take into account transitions to the exclusive low-lying states of the daughter
nucleus.

In case of the \Au{197} target, a transition \Au{197} --> $^{197}Pt$ to
the ground state of Pt nucleus is allowed. Given that the energy splitting between
an electron and a positron from the photon conversion is almost uniform,
the positron spectrum corresponding to such a transition, in a first approximation,
should be flat. 

probability of the order of $10^-3$,

\subsection{Final states with the broken down  daughter nucleus}

As a daughter nucleus produced in the process of radiative muon capture can
break down and emit one or several protons or neutrons, one could ask whether
photons from transitions
$$
\mu + \Au{197} \rightarrow \gamma + \nu + ^{197-k}Pt + k \rm ~neutrons
$$
or 
$$
\mu + \Au{197} \rightarrow \gamma + \nu + ^{197-k}A_{Z=79-k} + k \rm ~protons
$$

could have a higher positron energy spectrum end point.
Figure ~\ref{fig:pt197_dmass} shows the distributions for mass differences
between the final states consisting of (A'+k neutrons) and (A' + k protons),
and the ground state of $^{197}Pt$. Based on those distributions one can conclude
that events with the most energetic photons and, as such, most energetic 
positrons should correspond to transitions with ``unbroken'' $^{197}Pt$ nucleus
in the final state.

\subsection {Expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ signal in SINDRUM-II detector}

Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal} shows expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$
conversion signal in SINDRUM-II detector digitized from Figure 11 of \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}. 
The most probable value is at 95.0 MeV, consistent with the most probable energy
losses of 0.6 MeV in front of the tracker.

For Au, the expected position of $\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$ is about 3.9 MeV/c lower than
for $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ signal, the difference small enough to affect the momentum
resolution.
%
We therefore assume that the position and the shape of the $\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$
signal reconstructed in the SINDRUM-II detector can be reproduced by moving
the $\mu^- \rightarrow e^- $signal shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal}
by 4 MeV/c towards lower energies.

  \label{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal}
  Expected position and shape of the $\mu^- \rightarrow ~e^-$ conversion signal on Au

}
\vspace{0.1in}

Shown in Figure \ref{fig:ana_step2_sindrum_positron_best_fit_signal} is the expected
\mumepconv\ signal on Au target together with the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum and the
RMC background which normalization comes from the fit to the data. To guide the eye,
the signal is normalized to 20 events.

Interestingly, the event excess above 88 MeV/c has a shape consistent with the shape
of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ signal, however the average momentum of events in the group
is about 1 MeV lower than expected from the signal.
The estimated statistical uncertainty on the position of the center of gravity of those
events is 0.24 MeV/c, so the expected position of the $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion
signal is about 4$\sigma$ higher than calculated from the data.
This strongly disfavors the exotic ($mu e$ conversion) interpretation of the excess.

The track charge mis-identification probability of in the SINDRUM-II detector
is about 0.2\% \cite{sindrum_ii:Kaulard1998}, and can't explain the positron excess.
%
However, an excess of positron events near the RMC spectrum endpoint could be due
to a process of RMC accompanied by a transition to an exclusive final state
of the $^{197}Pt$ nucleus. As the ground state of \Au{197} has spin parity $3/2^+$
and the ground state of $^{197}Pt$ has spin-parity of $1/2-$, a dipole transition
between these two states is allowed and could result in a mono-energetic photons
with the energy E = 93.8 MeV. A uniform, in the first approximation, distribution
of the electron-positron energy splitting, could result in a a flat contribution 
added, near the endpoint, to the rapidly falling RMC spectrum. 

There are 456 events in the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum with P > 77 MeV/c,
14 out of those have P > 88 MeV/c. Attributing one event - with the highest
momentum - to cosmics, we're left with 13 events with the reconstructed 
positron momenta in the region 88-92 MeV/c. Assuming that all of them are due
to the Au(GS) --> Pt(GS) RMC transition, one can estimate the total number
of such events at $13*92/4 = 13*23 \sim\ 300$ events.
%
For an RMC spectrum with $k_{max}= 88$ MeV shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:rmc_photon_and_positron_spectra}, 
about 14\% events have the photon energy above 57 MeV/c.
TRIUMF RMC spectrometer measured 2000-3000 data events per spectrum \cite{}, that translates
into 15,000 - 20,000 events in the whole spectrum per nuclear target. 

Similarly, for $k_{max}= 88$ MeV, about $3.3\cdot 10^{-4}$ of all RMC positrons have
P > 77 MeV/c. So assuming momentum-independent efficiency, 442 reconstructed events
would correspond to 1.3e6 RMC events in the total spectrum and 1.9e5 RMC events with
the reconstructed photon P > 57 MeV. That is two orders of magnitude higher than
per-target statistics of the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer.

The extimated branching ratio of the exclusive GS->GS transition would be 
$\sim 3e^2/1.3e^6 ~ \sim ~ 2e^{-4}$, and for the TRIUMF statistics one would expect
$2e^4*2e^{-4} ~\sim 5$ events. For a photon energy resolution FWHM $\sim$ 7 MeV,
it would be rather difficult for the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer group to resolve exclusive
transitions of such strength in the measured spectra.

\section{ Summary }

\begin{itemize}
\item
  assuming that the RMC spectrum is described by the closure approximation,
  SINDRUM-II positron spectrum on Au target shows a statistically significant
  excess of events (roughly, 13 events with 1 expected) over the background
\item
  the limit on BGR comes from cosmics and RPC, RMC << 1  event
\item
  the excess looks like a bump with the width consistent with the detector
  resolution
\item
  the expected position of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion signal on Au is
  about 1 MeV/c or, statistically, 4*$\sigma_P$ higher, which strongly discourages
  the exotic interpretation
\item
  the excess could be due to and exclusive RMC transition Au(GS) --> Pt (GS)
  with the branching fraction of about $2\cdot10^{-4}$, which is spin/parity
  allowed. Given the statistics and the resolution of the published RMC
  measurements, such a transition would not be resolved. 
\item
  This observation has significant implications for the upcoming
  searches
  for the process of $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion. 
  to fully exploit the physics potential of experiments like Mu2e and COMET,
  a better theoretical understanding of the endpoint of the RMC spectrum
  on nuclei is needed. 
\item
  Without that, the sensitivity for might be limited by the presently unknown
  dipole RMC transitions to exclusive states of the daughter nuclei. 
\end{itemize}
