\section { Introduction}

The most stringent search limits for processes of \mumemconv\ and \mumepconv\
on nuclei come from the SINDRUM-II experiment :
$$
Br(\mumemconv[Au]) < 7\cdot 10^{-13}  ~~~\cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006},
$$
and
$$
Br(\mumepconv[Ti][Ca]) < 1.7\cdot 10^{-12}(GS) ~~~\cite{sindrum_ii:Kaulard1998}
$$

The statistics of muon stops collected by SINDRUM-II on the Au target is about 1.5-2 times higher
than the statistics collected on the Ti target. Along with the momentum spectrum of electrons, 
\cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006} shows the positron data - see Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_2006_fig_11},
however, no limit on \mumepconv\ on a gold target has been published.

At a closer look, the positron spectrum on gold target
shown in Figure \ref{fig:sindrum_ii_2006_fig_11} seems to have a bump
near the high-momentum spectrum endpoint. 
This note presents an attempt to understand the origin of the bump
and its implications for the Mu2e search for the process of \mumepconv\ .

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\newpage
\section { Approach}

The structure of this note is as follows:


We start from developing a parameterized model of the SINDRUM-II detector response
and tuning parameters of the model to describe the electron data of \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}. 


The tuning procedure assumes that the measured electron spectrum is dominated
by electrons produced in muon decays in orbit (DIO). This assumption
doesn't take into account a contribution of electrons from converted RMC photons. 
Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_2006_fig_11} shows that in the vicinity of 90 MeV/c
that contribution is non-negligible and needs to be taken into account.
However, as the momentum spectrum of electrons coming from RMC photon
conversions is not given in \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}, and it is different
from the positron spectrum dominantly due to Compton scattering,
we just acknowledge the presence of the RMC contribution in the SINDRUM-II
electron data, but don't take any action. 

To model the electron data, SINDRUM-II used the DIO spectrum calculated
for the muonic Pb atom, tabulated in \cite{Watanabe_1993}. The spectrum was
corrected for the difference in the binding energies in \Au{197} and \Pb{208}.
The parameterized model of the SINDRUM-II detector response developed in Section
\ref{sec:detector_response} uses the same DIO spectrum as input. 

We next assume that the detector response - resolution and efficiency - 
is the same for electrons and positrons of the same momentum,
and use the tuned model of SINDRUM-II response to describe the positron spectrum
from \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}. The spectrum is dominated by the positrons 
coming from conversions of RMC photons in the detector material as well as
direct production of $e^+e^-$ pairs in the process of nuclear muon capture.

To predict the momentum spectrum of positrons, one needs to know the
energy distribution of photons produced in radiative muon capture on gold.   

We assume that for energies at least a few MeV below the endpoint the RMC photon
spectrum can be described by the closure approximation model and we fit the
positron spectrum below 88 MeV/c to determine the model parameter $\kmax$ defining
the shape of the photon energy spectrum. After that, we predict the expected 
RMC contribution in the positron spectrum above 88 MeV/c and quantify the observed
excess of events in that region.

Finally, we check if the observed excess is consistent with the signal expected from
\mumepconv\ on \Au{197}.

\section {Events above 88 MeV and \mumepconv\ signal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection {Positron momentum spectrum}

Figure \ref{fig:ana_step2_ppos_best_fit} overlays the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum
on the \Au{197}\ target with the closure approximation spectrum convolved with the 
parameterized model of the SINDRUM-II detector response.

There are 14 events above 88 MeV/c in the data. Looking at the data above 94 MeV/c,
we can estimate the background due to radiative pion capture (RPC) and cosmics to be
of the order of one event. The prediction the closure approximation-based RMC model
gives is significantly less than one event above 88 MeV/c. 

One therefore needs to ask whether the closure approximation reliably describes
the RMC positron spectrum near the endpoint. In particular, the closure approximation
doesn't take into account RMC transitions to the exclusive low-lying states of the 
daughter nucleus.

In the case of the \Au{197} target, a transition \Au{197} $\ra$ $^{197} \rm Pt$ to
the ground state of the Pt nucleus is allowed. Given that the energy splitting between
an electron and a positron from a photon conversion is almost uniform,
the positron spectrum corresponding to such a transition, in a first approximation,
should be flat. The positron momentum spectrum could extend up to 92.7 MeV, so a contribution
of such a transition could reduce the tension between the background model and the data.
Below, we estimate the probability of such a transition corresponding to 13 RMC events
in the region 88 < $p_{e^+}$ < 92.7 MeV.

\subsection{Final states with the broken down daughter nucleus}

As a daughter nucleus produced in the process of radiative muon capture can
break down and emit one or several protons or neutrons, one could also ask
whether photons from transitions
$$
\mu + \Au{197} \rightarrow \gamma + \nu + ^{197-k}Pt + k \rm ~neutrons
$$
or 
$$
\mu + \Au{197} \rightarrow \gamma + \nu + ^{197-k}A_{Z=78-k} + k \rm ~protons
$$

could produce positrons with a higher energy spectrum endpoint.
Figure ~\ref{fig:pt197_dmass} shows the distributions of mass differences
between the final states consisting of ($^{197-k} \rm Pt$$ + k$ neutrons) and 
($^{197-k}A_{Z=78-k} + k$ protons),
and the ground state of the $^{197} \rm Pt$ nucleus.
Based on those distributions one can conclude that events with the most energetic photons
and, as such, most energetic positrons should correspond to transitions with the ``unbroken''
$^{197} \rm Pt$ nucleus in the final state.
As such a final state corresponds to a positron momentum kinematic endpoint of 93.8 MeV/c,
and the excess begins at 92 MeV/c, final states with a mass increase greater
than $\sim 2$ MeV/c$^2$ wouldn't be able to explain the excess, which is true for
transitions to any final state other than the final state with the ``unbroken'' $^{197} \rm Pt$
nucleus.

\subsection {Expected $\mumepconv$ signal in SINDRUM-II detector}

Figure \ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal} shows the expected $\mumemconv[Au]$
conversion signal in the SINDRUM-II detector, digitized from Figure 11 of \cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006}. 
The most probable value is at 95.0 MeV/c, consistent with the most probable energy
losses of 0.6 MeV in front of the tracker.

The expected position of the $\mumepconv[Au][Ir]$ conversion signal is about 3.9 MeV/c
lower than for the $\mumemconv[Au]$ signal; the difference is small enough to not affect
the momentum resolution.
%

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] at (0,0.) {
    % \node[shift={(0 cm,0.cm)},inner sep=0,rotate={90}] at (0,0) {}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c] {
      \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/pdf/sindrum_ii_ce_signal}

  \label{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal}
  The expected position and shape of the $\mu^- \rightarrow ~e^-$ conversion signal on Au
  in the SINDRUM-II detector.
}
\vspace{0.1in}

We therefore assume that the expected position and the shape of the positron signal from
$\mu^-\rightarrow e^+$ conversion reconstructed in the SINDRUM-II detector can be reproduced
by moving the $\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ signal shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:sindrum_ii_ce_signal}
by 4 MeV/c down.
%
The expected \mumepconv\ signal on the \Au{197}\ target is shown in
Figure  \ref{fig:ana_step2_sindrum_positron_best_fit_signal} together
with the SINDRUM-II positron data on the Au target and the RMC background. 
The RMC normalization comes from the fit to the data in the region p < 88 MeV/c.
To guide the eye, the $e^+$ conversion signal is normalized to 20 events.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] at (0,0.) {
    % \node[shift={(0 cm,0.cm)},inner sep=0,rotate={90}] at (0,0) {}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c] {
      \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/png/ana_step2_sindrum_positron_best_fit_signal}
    }
  };

  SINDRUM-II positron spectrum overlaid with the expected background from RMC
  and a signal from \mumepconv\ normalized to 20 events. Normalization is chosen
  to guide the eye.
}
\end{figure}

The excess of events above 88 MeV/c has a shape consistent with the shape
of the expected $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ signal; however, the average momentum of the
data events in the group is about 1 MeV/c lower than expected from the signal.
The estimated statistical uncertainty on the position of the center of gravity of those
events is 0.24 MeV/c, so the expected position of the $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ conversion
signal is about 4$\sigma$ higher than calculated from the data.
This strongly disfavors the exotic ($\mu e$ conversion) interpretation of the excess.

The track charge mis-identification probability in the SINDRUM-II detector
is about 0.2\% \cite{sindrum_ii:Kaulard1998}, and it can't explain the excess
of positron events .
%
However, the excess could be due to the process of RMC accompanied by a nuclear
transition from a ground state of \Au{197} to an exclusive final state
of $^{197}\rm Pt$. As the ground state of \Au{197} has spin parity $3/2^+$
and the ground state of $^{197} \rm Pt$ has spin-parity of $1/2-$,
an allowed dipole transition between the two states could result in mono-energetic
photons with the energy E = 93.8 MeV. A uniform, in the first approximation,
distribution of the electron-positron energy splitting could result in a a flat
contribution extending up to P = 93.3 MeV/c added to the rapidly falling positron
spectrum from converted RMC photons. 

In total, the SINDRUM-II positron spectrum on Au target has 456 events with p > 77 MeV/c.
14 out of 456 events have p > 88 MeV/c. Attributing one event - with the highest
momentum - to cosmics/RPC, we're left with 13 events with reconstructed positron
momenta in the region 88-92 MeV/c. Assuming that all of them are due to the
Au(GS) $\ra$ Pt(GS) RMC transition and a flat positron spectrum from 0 - 92 MeV/c,
one can estimate the total number of such events as $13\text{ events}/4\text{ MeV/c}\cdot 92\text{ MeV/c} = 13\cdot 23 \sim\ 300$ events.

For an RMC spectrum with $\kmax = 88$ MeV, shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:rmc_photon_and_positron_spectra}, 
about 14\% of photons have energies above 57 MeV.
The TRIUMF RMC spectrometer measured 2000-3000 data events per target \cite{RMC_1999_PhysRevC.59.2853}.
Given an experimental energy cutoff of 57 MeV, that translates into 15,000 - 20,000
events in the whole spectrum. 

Similarly, for $\kmax= 88$ MeV, about $3.3\cdot 10^{-4}$ of all RMC positrons have
p > 77 MeV/c. Assuming momentum-independent efficiency, 442 reconstructed events
with p > 77 MeV/c correspond to $1.3\cdot 10^6$ RMC events in the full spectrum
and $1.9\cdot 10^5$ RMC events with photon energies above 57 MeV. This is two orders
of magnitude higher than the per-target statistics of the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer.

\end{figure}

The branching ratio of the exclusive transition could be estimated at 
$\sim 3\cdot 10^2/1.3\cdot 10^6 ~ \sim ~ 2\cdot 10^{-4}$, so for a typical per-target
statistics of the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer one would expect such a transition
to contribute $2\cdot 10^4\cdot 2\cdot 10^{-4} ~\sim 5$ events.
Given the photon energy resolution of FWHM $\sim$ 7 MeV, it would be rather difficult
for the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer to resolve exclusive transitions of such strength
in the measured spectra.

\section{ Summary }
%% Attempt at summary
In their 2006 paper which sets the current best limit on \mumemconv\ on gold target
\cite{sindrum_ii:Bertl2006},
the SINDRUM-II collaboration, along with the electron momentum distribution, published 
the momentum distribution of reconstructed positrons. Near the positron spectrum
endpoint, there is an excess of events which has not been discussed by the authors.

To understand the implications of this excess, we developed a simple detector
response model, tuned it using the SINDRUM-II electron data, and used the tuned
model to describe the positron data.

The excess of high-momentum events in the positron data is statistically significant,
comprised of about 13 events with a background expectation of about 1.
The background expectation is dominantly due to RPC and cosmics, the RMC background
above 88 MeV/c is $\ll 1$ event. 

Interestingly, the excess has a width consistent with the detector resolution.
The expected position of the $\mumepconv[Au]$ signal is 1 MeV/c, or $4\sigma_p$,
higher, which strongly discourages an exotic ($\mu e$ conversion) interpretation.

The excess could be due to an exclusive dipole RMC transition between 
$^{197} \rm Au(GS)$$\ra$$^{197} \rm Pt(GS)$, with a branching fraction of about
$2\cdot 10^{-4}$. Given the statistics and resolution of the published RMC
measurements, such a transition would not be resolved experimentally.

The observation has significant implications for the upcoming searches
for the process of $\mumepconv$ conversion. To fully exploit the physics
potential of experiments such as Mu2e and COMET, a better theoretical
understanding of the endpoint of the RMC spectrum on nuclei is needed.
A high-resolution measurement of the RMC photon spectra needs to be carried
out and compared to the theoretical predictions. Without that, the sensitivity
of the upcoming searches might be limited by the unknown probabilities of RMC
transitions to the exclusive low lying states of the daughter nuclei.

\section{Calculation of the positron energy in $\mumepconv[Au][Ir]$ conversion}
We consider only the ground state conversion process. 
For this, the conversion energy is given by:
$$
E_{e^+} = m_\mu - B_\mu - E_{recoil} - \Delta_{Z-2}
$$

where $m_\mu$ is the muon mass, $B_\mu$ is the binding energy of the 1s energy level,
$E_{recoil}$ is the energy of the recoiling nucleus, and $\Delta_{Z-2}$ is the difference
between the incoming and outgoing nuclear masses.

Since the muon orbit is $\sim$ 200 times closer to the nucleus than the electrons',
one can assume the electrons do not contribute to the muon capture process. Therefore,
the electron masses are not considered and instead only the nuclear masses are used:
$M_N = M_A-Z\cdot m_e$, where $M_A=A_r\cdot u$, $A_r$ is the relative mass, 
u is the atomic mass unit, and $m_e$ is the electron mass.

The recoiling energy is given by considering the two body decay: $N(\mu^-+\Au{197}) \ra e^+ + \Ir{197}$.
Considering the rest frame of the muonic gold atom, the decay products must satisfy
$p_{e^+} + p_{^{197}Ir} = p_{o} = 0$. The energy of the iridium mucleus is then given by:
$$
E_{^{197}Ir} = \frac{M^2 + M_N(\Ir{197})^2 - m_e^2}{2M} = E_{recoil} + M_N(\Ir{197})
$$
where M is the mass of the muonic gold nucleus system, $M=M_N(\Au{197}) + m_\mu - B_\mu = 183528.405$ MeV/c$^2$.
Using the parameters in Table \ref{table:parameters}, we get $E_{recoil} = 0.023$ MeV.

Combining these together, the $\mumepconv[Au][Ir]$ positron energy for the ground state
transition is $E_{e^+} = 91.657(21)$ MeV, where the uncertainty on $B_\mu$ is assumed to be $\sim$0.001 MeV.
