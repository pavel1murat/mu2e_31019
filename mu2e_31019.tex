    Positron data of the SINDRUM-II experiment on Au target have
    an interesting feature near the spectrum endpoint.
    We are trying to understand implications of that for the Mu2e
    search for \mumepconv\ .

\section { Introduction}

The most stringent search limits for processes of \mumemconv\ and \mumepconv\
on nuclei come from the SINDRUM-II experiment \cite{sindrum_ii_Bertl2006}.

Br($\mu^- Au \rightarrow e^- Au) < 7·10^{-13}$ and

$Br(\mu^- Ti \rightarrow e^+ Ca) < 1.7·10^{-12}(GS)$

SINDRUM-II collected x2 muon stops on Au data as the 1997 Ti data,
and their '2006 paper also presented the positron data.
However no limit on \mumepconv\ has been published.

In this note we're trying to take a close look at the SINDRUM-II positron data
and understand their implications for the Mu2e search for \mumepconv\ .

Positron spectrum seems to have a bump near its high-momentum endpoint.
In this note we try to understand what are the implications of this bump
for the Mu2e search for the process of \mumepconv\ .

\section { Approach}

We start from assuming that the dominant background in electron channel comes from DIO,
while the positron spectrum is dominated by the positrons from RMC photon conversions.
For \Au{197}, these assumptions hold better for positrons than for electrons:
in the vicinity of 90 MeV, RMC electrons also need to be taken into account.
There are more electrons than positrons (Compton scattering of the RMC photons),
so we just acknowledge the fact, but don't take any action, as the momentum distribution
of the electrons due to Compton scattering is not given in the 2006 paper.

SINDRUM-II used DIO spectrum on Pb tabulated in Watanabe'93 and corrected for the
difference of binding energies in \Au{197} and \Pb{208} for the DIO.

We use the electron spectrum to develop a simple parameterized model of
the SINDRUM-II detector response. The parameters include the momentum resolution,
assumed to be constant, and the overall reconstruction efficiency dependence on the 
track momentum.

We then use the response model to fit the positron spectrum below 88 MeV and
determine the RMC kMax. After that, we can predict the expected background
above 88 MeV and quantify the observed excess.

Finally we check if the observed excess is consistent with the signal expected from
\mumepconv\ on \Au{197}.
